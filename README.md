⏳ Countdown Timer
A simple and clean countdown timer built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Enter a number,
click "Start Countdown", and watch it tick down to zero — with a smooth animation and user-friendly validation.

🛠 Features
✅ Live countdown from user input

🚫 Input validation for empty or invalid entries

♻️ Auto-reset before each new countdown

💥 Pop animation on each tick for a digital feel

 How It Works
User enters a positive number (e.g. 10)

Timer starts ticking down every second

On reaching 0, an alert notifies: "Time’s up!"

Timer resets and input field clears for the next round

🎯 What I Learned
This project helped me:

Practice DOM element selection and manipulation

Handle timer logic with setInterval and clearInterval

Build simple UX patterns for input validation

Apply consistent UI styling with custom CSS variables

📌 Future Improvements
Add support for countdown to a specific date/time

Play a sound when time is up

Improve mobile responsiveness further
